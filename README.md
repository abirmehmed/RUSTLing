### Day 1-5: Introduction to Rust and Basic Syntax

**Day 1: Introduction to Rust**
- Overview of Rust
- Setting up the environment (Rustup, Cargo)
- First "Hello, World!" program
- Understanding compiled languages vs. interpreted languages.

**Day 2: Basic Syntax**
- Variables (let keyword, mutability)
- Data types (integers, floats, booleans)
- Operators (+, -, \*, /).

**Day 3: Control Flow**
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (loop, while loop).

**Day 4: Functions in Rust**
- Function basics (declaring and calling functions)
- Function arguments and return types.

**Day 5: Practice Problems on Basics**

### Day 6–10 Compound Data Types

#### **Compound Data Types**

*   **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections.
*   **Vectors**: Dynamic arrays.
*   **Tuples**: Collections of different data types.

#### Specific Days:

*   **Day6:** Arrays  
        * Declaring arrays  
        * Accessing array elements  

    ```rust
    let arr = [1;10]; // Array of ten ones
    ```

*   **Day7:** Vectors  
        * Creating vectors (`Vec::new()`, `vec![]`)  
        * Adding elements (`push`, `insert`)

    ```rust
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(1);
    ```

*   **Day8:** Tuples  
        * Creating tuples `(type1,type2)`  
        * Accessing tuple elements using indexing or pattern matching

    ```rust
    let tup = ("hello", true);
    println!("{}", tup.0); // Prints "hello"
    ```

*   **9:** Strings in Rust   
      - Creating strings (`String::from()`, string literals)   
      - String operations (`+`, `format!()`)

      ```rust
      let s = String::from("Hello");
      println!("{} world!", s); // Using format!
      ```

### Day11–15 Object-Oriented Programming Basics

#### OOP Concepts in Rust

Rust supports object-oriented programming through structs and enums.

Specific Days:

1\. Structs – Defining Custom Types


\*\*

\*\*

Structs allow you to create custom data structures.


Example code demonstrating struct definition:


```rust
struct Person {
name:String,
age:i32,
}
```
2\. Enums – Defining Enumerations


Enums are used for defining a set of named values.


Example code demonstrating enum definition:


```rust
enum Color {
Red,
Green,
Blue,
}
```
3\. Methods & Associated Functions


Methods are functions defined inside an impl block for structs/enums.


Associated functions are like static methods but belong to the type itself.


Example code showing method implementation:


```rust
impl Person {
fn greet(&self) {
println!("Hello!");
}
}
```
Days Dedicated to Each Topic:


\-day11:\ Structs\
\-day12:\ Enums\
\-day13:\ Methods & Associated Functions\
\-day14:\ Implementing Traits\
\-day15:\ Practice Problems on OOP Concepts



Implement real-world scenarios using these OOP principles.

### Day16–20 Advanced Topics in Object-Oriented Programming & Error Handling

#### Advanced OOP Topics


Polymorphism allows objects of different classes related by traits to be treated as if they were of the same type.


Operator Overloading allows customization of operators like + or << for user-defined data types.


Templates aren’t directly available; instead, use generics which allow writing reusable code that can work with multiple data types without needing explicit casting.



Error Handling Mechanisms include Result type and Option enum which help manage potential failures gracefully.



Days Dedicated:

\-day16:\ Polymorphism Examples\
\-day17:\ Operator Overloading\
\-day18:\ Generics Basics\
\-day19:\ Advanced Error Handling Techniques\
\-day20:\ Practical Exercises on Advanced OOP & Error Handling



Combine polymorphism/operator overloading/generics/error handling concepts into comprehensive projects.

### Day21–25 File Input/Output & Modules/Crates Management

File I/O Operations include reading/writing text files (.txt), binary files (.bin).


Modules help organize your code into logical units that can be reused across projects or shared as crates via Cargo package manager.




Specific Days:


21.\ Reading Text Files (.txt)\
22.\ Writing Text Files (.txt)\
23.\ Reading/Writing Binary Files (.bin)\
24.\ Modules Organization \
25.\ Crates Management with Cargo



Implement file handling tasks combined with module management techniques using Cargo packages.



---

### Day26–30 Final Projects & Review Sessions


Final Project Development Days:

Develop comprehensive projects incorporating all learned concepts such as data structures/algorithms/OOP/file handling/error management/etc., into real-world applications like games/calculators/chatbots/etc., depending on interest level/skill set/time available.




Review Sessions:



Spend time reviewing key concepts covered throughout the course focusing particularly on areas where improvement is needed based on feedback/practice results/test scores etc., ensuring solid foundational understanding before moving forward beyond this beginner’s course scope.




Final Assessment/Test Preparation:



Prepare students for potential assessments/tests by practicing past exams/sample questions/review quizzes covering major topics discussed during these thirty days ensuring readiness/confidence when facing actual evaluations later down line whether academic/professional settings alike!
