# **Day 1: Introduction to Rust**

Welcome to Day 1 of your Rust programming journey! Today, weâ€™ll cover the basics of Rust, set up your development environment, write your first Rust program, and explore the differences between compiled and interpreted languages. Letâ€™s dive in!

## **1. Overview of Rust**

### What is Rust?
Rust is a modern systems programming language designed for **performance**, **safety**, and **concurrency**. It was created by Graydon Hoare and is now maintained by the Rust Foundation. Rust is known for its memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, making it ideal for low-level programming tasks like operating systems, game engines, and embedded systems.

### Key Features of Rust:
- **Memory Safety**: Rust ensures memory safety at compile time using its ownership model, preventing common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.
- **Concurrency**: Rust makes it easier to write concurrent programs by preventing data races at compile time.
- **Performance**: Rust is as fast as C/C++ and is often used in performance-critical applications.
- **Modern Tooling**: Rust comes with a powerful package manager (`Cargo`) and a rich ecosystem of libraries.

## **2. Setting Up the Environment**

To start programming in Rust, youâ€™ll need to set up your development environment. Rust provides an easy-to-use toolchain installer called **Rustup**.

### Installing Rustup
1. **Visit the Rustup Website**: Go to [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/).
2. **Install Rustup**:
   - On **Linux/macOS**, run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
   - On **Windows**, download and run the `rustup-init.exe` installer from the website.
3. **Follow the Prompts**: The installer will guide you through the setup process. Choose the default options unless you have specific preferences.

### Verifying the Installation
Once Rustup is installed, verify the installation by running:
```bash
rustc --version
```
This should display the installed Rust version (e.g., `rustc 1.75.0`).

### What is Cargo?
Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. It handles:
- Compiling your code.
- Downloading and managing dependencies.
- Running tests.
- Building documentation.

Check if Cargo is installed:
```bash
cargo --version
```

## **3. First "Hello, World!" Program**

Letâ€™s write your first Rust program: the classic "Hello, World!".

### Steps:
1. **Create a New Project**:
   Use Cargo to create a new project:
   ```bash
   cargo new hello_world
   cd hello_world
   ```
   This creates a directory called `hello_world` with the following structure:
   ```
   hello_world/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
   â””â”€â”€ src/
       â””â”€â”€ main.rs
   ```

2. **Write the Code**:
   Open the `src/main.rs` file and replace its content with:
   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("Hello, World!");
   }
   ```
   - `fn main()`: Defines the main function, the entry point of the program.
   - `println!`: A macro that prints text to the console.

3. **Run the Program**:
   Use Cargo to compile and run the program:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
   You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

## **4. Understanding Compiled Languages vs. Interpreted Languages**

### Compiled Languages (e.g., Rust, C, C++)
- **How They Work**: The source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. The resulting binary file can be run directly by the computer.
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster execution since the code is already translated into machine language.
  - Better performance for system-level tasks.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Longer development cycle due to the need for compilation.
  - Platform-specific binaries (you need to compile for each target platform).

### Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- **How They Work**: The source code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easier to debug and test since thereâ€™s no separate compilation step.
  - Platform-independent (the same code can run on any platform with the interpreter).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slower execution compared to compiled languages.
  - Less control over low-level system resources.

### Rust as a Compiled Language
Rust is a compiled language, meaning your code is translated into machine code before execution. This gives Rust its performance advantages but requires a compilation step during development.

## **Summary of Day 1**
- **Rust Overview**: A modern systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency.
- **Environment Setup**: Installed Rust using Rustup and learned about Cargo.
- **First Program**: Wrote and ran a "Hello, World!" program in Rust.
- **Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages**: Explored the differences and understood why Rust is a compiled language.

## **Next Steps**
- Explore Rustâ€™s syntax and basic concepts (variables, data types, functions).
- Learn about Rustâ€™s ownership model, a key feature that ensures memory safety.
